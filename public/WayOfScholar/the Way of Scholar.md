#  **the Way of Scholar (WoS)**

The core story of WoS is about a sage who saved a child and imprisoned him, and the child can only gain freedom by finding 256 golden book pages from the library. However, the child gradually becomes obsessed with reading during his search and eventually discovers that the final golden page is in his hometown. In the process, he adopts a child and educates him in the same way. Over generations, a ritual is formed where students must burn the last page of the 256 pages they prepared and find the remaining 255 pages hidden in the library before they can become scholars.

In this story, the process of the sage asking the child to find the golden pages and the students becoming scholars is a process of transformation from content to form, while the childâ€™s transition from casual reading to becoming obsessed with reading is a process from form to content. I attempt to use this story to discuss the formation and inheritance of rituals and the relationship between traditional art and ritual. The following topics can be discussed based on this story:

1. The alienation from content to form and the absorption from form to content
2. Art as a form, conceptualization, and ritualization of its content
3. The anti-alienation function of traditional art practice in contemporary art
4. From holistic art to ritual to the subdivision of art, and using this to explore the origin and definition of art

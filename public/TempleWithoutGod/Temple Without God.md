# **Temple Without God (TWG)**

The core story of TWG tells a tale recorded in a temple: a believer searches for a nonexistent god and through his actions, becomes a god himself. But once he stops searching, he is no longer a god and must start searching again. Meanwhile, the temple exists because of the believer’s presence and collapses when he disappears. This story uses basic concepts of semiotics to create a multi-layered, infinitely recursive narrative. The believer’s ascent and descent is one loop, the temple’s creation and destruction is another loop, and the audience’s search for the nonexistent temple is a third loop. In this story, the god can serve as a metaphor for many metaphysical concepts, and I mainly use it to reflect on the theme of the meaning of life in an existential context. Related issues include:

1. The dialectic of the existence and disappearance of concepts.
2. The comparison between finite life and infinite meaning.
3. The dialectic of rational goal and intuitive-related practice.
4. Pre-modern, modern, and post-modern temples (temples, factories, and exchanges) in religions before the post-modern period, mass production, and currency.

Current works based on this theme include:

1. Temple 1
2. Temple 2
3. Temple 3

# With What Can I Hold You Back (WWCIHYB) 

WWCIHYB does not have a core story. Instead, it consists of a series of stories, all of which point to the insignificance of the individual. This sense of insignificance occurs on two levels. The first is the smallness of finite life in the face of infinite time and space, where aging is a common theme in these stories. The second is the smallness of the individual in the face of the Leviathan of society, with disappearing people being a common image. While this may seem related to apathy, my intention is not to criticize apathy through this work, but rather to acknowledge it and discuss ways to reduce this fragility on both an individual and structural level.

Works created under this theme include:

1. With What Can I Hold You Back
2. His Story
3. Yun Gang Project

In terms of creative practice, this section serves as a reservoir for my writing, with the stories of the other three projects being selected from this series as they offer more room for discussion and independence. If there are future updates to this series, they are likely to emerge from this collection. I prefer to use metal welding and tar to create a slender, decaying, neutral image of an ageless, tired person as a symbol of the collective march towards death.

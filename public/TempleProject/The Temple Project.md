# The Temple Project



 The Temple Project is a personal art project led by Liu Rui. The aim of this project is to explore the philosophy of life and its application in the art field through the intersection of art and blockchain technology. The objective is to create an artistic community centered around reflection, using art creation as a symbol and blockchain technology as a medium.

# Once and Once Again (OaOA)

The core story of OaOA tells of an old man reminiscing about his life, murmuring “once and once again” as he does so. Using this story, I hope to discuss the value of repetition in the creative process. This theme can lead to questions such as:

1. Universal values, knowledge, and truth, and the repetition and emptiness of fate
2. Action-oriented creation
3. The possibilities of replication and iteration in art in the context of technology

In practical creative practice, this theme is also used to provide a context for my material and technique experimentation and training. That is, using “repetition” as the theme, conducting material experiments and technique experiments, while improving and mastering techniques, and considering the possibility of participating in other creations.

Currently, material experiments based on this creation include:

1. Paper writing
2. Binary text knitting
3. Art book making
4. Binary text weaving 
5. Generative art coding

In the future, I will try more materials and techniques based on this theme and invite other artists to participate in this creative theme.
